This project is a web application designed to provide current weather information for various locations. It utilizes React.js for the frontend development and integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

Users can enter a city name, and the app will display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a representative weather icon.
